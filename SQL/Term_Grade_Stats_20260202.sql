   QUERY: Course Grade Metrics (Non-Final Grade Counts + Final-Grade Stats)
   AUTHOR: Jeff Kelley
   DATE:   2026-02-02
   NOTE:   Snowflake SQL. Provided without support or warranty.

   PURPOSE:
     - Per-course metrics for a given term:
       * Student count (enrolled, enabled, non-preview)
       * Count of non-final gradebook items
       * Count of non-final grades recorded (non-NULL scores)
       * Final-grade stats: max, min, avg, IQR
     - Instructor selection:
       * If one instructor → return that one
       * If multiple and a primary exists → return primary
       * If multiple and no primary → return first by email (deterministic)
